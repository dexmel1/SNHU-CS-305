Software Security
## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client?
Artemis Financial is a company that provides financial services while handling sensitive client data.
## What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial wanted to enhance its software security and modernize its web application, specifically by implementing secure file verification for data transfers.
## What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? 
I implemented a secure controller and integrated a hashing algorithm for file transfers. This ensured data integrity by comparing the original and received hash values.
## Why is it important to code securely? 
Code security protects sensitive information and prevents incidents such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyber threats. 
## What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
By adhering to industry-standard practices, companies ensure regulation compliance, help maintain client trust, and protect their reputation.
## Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Working with Maven dependency checking was challenging in a good way, as it was a new technology I was exposed to during the course.
## How did you increase layers of security? 
I increased layers of security by implementing SHA-256 as well as enforcing HTTPS for secure communication.
## In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I would use dependency-checking software and manual code review and prioritize mitigations based on severity.
## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? 
I conducted testing and vulnerability scans after each major code update to maintain functionality and security.
## After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By re-running dependency checks after major refactoring, I was able to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.
## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I would use Maven dependency checking, Java’s built-in cryptographic libraries, and manual code review to ensure the application was both functional and secure.
## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would use this project to demonstrate secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments, and the ability to match industry standards.
